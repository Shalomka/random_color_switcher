# random_color_switcher

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Hello and welcome to my code. This is animated experiment with Riverpod 2,
generating random colors for the material seed to reload the whole theme.
It has semantics for the gesture detector and high text contrast for
visually impaired (henche changing the theme, not only the container color).

Slava Ukraini!
